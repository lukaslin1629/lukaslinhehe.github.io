### CPSC 120-05

* Lab 3

    Lab 3, part 2 was one of my favorite labs, because I did not know before how to take user inputs well, and this lab helped me understand how to take user input and store them in variables in code, to run them through equations. I liked being able to create games.

* Lab 5

    Lab 5, part 3 was also one of my favorite labs, because I learned how to create a game (Blackjack) using code, like lab 3 part 2. It was hard for me to do this one at the time, because it seemed complicated, but it really was just learning conditions and using my knowledge of equations and combining them together. 

* Lab 6

    Lab 6, part 1 was kind of a favorite, because it was my first experience with loops. I learned how to create a loop, with a break which I liked. This was interesting to me because a fundamental part of code are loops, as it saves time from repetitively adding more code.  Of course, this was a guessing game but it still helped us learn breaks and making sure that the code ran fine.
